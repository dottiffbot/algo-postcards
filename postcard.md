##design process
![coum postcard](/assets/coum-card.png)
I started by searching for postcards from the coum transmissions as reference. On a thumbdrive somewhere I have scans from the Victoria & Albert museum of a bunch of them. Not too many came up in an internet search, but I liked this one. My card isn't too similar but I did start with the pink rectangle.

I had this weird idea that maybe I could 3D scan my hand and the postcard could be like I was waving or something. 

##code process

this code is pretty simple, since I'm so new to p5 honestly. I started with some javascript for web, thinking about how I could randomly write people's names on the page, letter by letter from an array. I wanted the letters to be kind of randomly placed, but figured that would be difficult if there was always a varying amount of letters.

##tips

click anywhere to change the background color!

hit the s key to save the canvas!

##some issues

it's not super responsive, sorry. 

the 3D model definitely takes a lot of computing power

in the end, for printing's sake, I tried making each name have at least 8 characters. I did not do this algorithmically, although I guess I could have with more time. 


##finally, printed
